Dogs are domesticated 
members of the family Canidae.
 They are classified as a subspecies 
 of Canis lupus, along with wolves 
 and dingoes.[5][6] 
 Dogs were domesticated 
 from wolves over 
 14,000 years ago by 
 hunter-gatherers, 
 before the development of agriculture.[7][8] The remains of the Bonn–Oberkassel dog, 
 buried alongside humans between 
 14,000 and 15,000 years ago, 
 are the earliest to be conclusively 
 identified as a domesticated dog.[9][7] Genetic studies show that dogs likely diverged from wolves between 27,000 and 40,000 years ago.[10][11] The dingo and the related New Guinea singing dog resulted from the geographic isolation and feralization of dogs in Oceania over 8,000 years ago.[12][13]
